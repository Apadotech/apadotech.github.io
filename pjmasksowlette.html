<h1 style="color:red;">Owlette</h1>

<body>
<p style="color:red;">Owlette, with her sharp mind and super planning skills, is quick to act. She can fly, has amazing eyesight, and when she flaps her powerful wings, the bad guys are sent airborne! Keep your “Owl Eyes!” on Owlette!

Amaya can be somewhat impatient at times and tends to have a bit of an ego when something lucky happens to her, such as the time she got a lucky basketball shot in "Owlette the Winner." She can also be a bit selfish at times. Despite this, she is very sweet and cares for Connor and Greg and their safety. She's also helpful, friendly, and smart, but still naive.
<br>
<br>
As Owlette she is very quick with her abilities. Like her fellow teammates, childlike immaturity tends to overtake her mindset on the mission leading to issues (such as becoming too focused on her tablet in "Supersonic Owlette" and refusing to forgive Catboy for an earlier mistake in "Owlette Terrible Pterodactyl Troble"), but this is always realized and corrected leading to the mission being done properly, and the villain's plans foiled.
<br>
<br>
When she got zapped by the Baby Beam and turned into Chicklette in "Terrible Two-Some." she can be very mischievous, sleepy, and sometimes whiny, and she has trouble flying until Gekko taught her. She also likes to draw on walls with chalk.
<br>
<br>
When Owlette got zapped by the Opposite Ray and turned into Dark Owl in "Gekko and the Opposite Ray," she is evil and hostile, as she and Night Panther are super enemies with Gekko. However, she always argues with Night Panther. She also appears to be competitive, since she and Night Panther competed against each other when trying to defeat Gekko.
<br>
<br>
Owlette and the rest of the PJ Masks will fight various nighttime villains that are scientifically oriented, most of her appearances often involve her and the team stopping villains from stealing stuff.
<br>
<br>
As Dark Owl, she and Night Panther are motivated by their desire to have the things they want by any means necessary, while acting as an associate for other villains such as Romeo.
<br>
<br>
Her motive as a villain is similar to Luna Girl's motive on stealing.
<br>
<br>
Super Owl Eyes: Can see in the dark, and see things from very far away.
<br>
<br>
Super Owl Wings: Her primary power; she can fly with her cape, like wings.
<br>
<br>
Owl Wing Wind: Can create powerful gusts of wind with her owl wings.
<br>
<br>
Super Owl Feathers: A power gained in "PJ Power Up," she can shoot energy feathers from her owl wings. These feathers come in various sizes, and can be used for multiple purposes, like projectiles, or to trap an opponent.
<br>
<br>
Super Feather Shield: Can create a large shield using her owl feathers.
<br>
<br>
Super Owl Swoop: Can perform a maneuver while flying.
<br>
<br>
Amulet Symbol: When pressed, she can communicate with her spirit animal (represented as the Pigeon).
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In some of Amaya's appearances in Season 2, she is erroneously seen without eyelashes.
<br>
